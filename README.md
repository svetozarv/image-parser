# image-parser
There are 2 scripts in the repo, that can automatically retrieve all images from:
1. dynamically generated site in real time (`selenium-parser.py`)
2. pre-downloaded HTML file (`image-parser-updt.py`)

Latest version of Chrome and undetected-chromedriver required

Note from 12.09.2024: `selenium-parser.py` may no longer work due to UI updates
